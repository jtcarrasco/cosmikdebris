I'm Jason, a technology enthusiast with a passion for building, breaking, and learning.

My professional work lives at [jtcarrasco.com](https://jtcarrasco.com), but this site? This is where the fun stuff happens—my maker projects, Linux adventures, hardware hacks, and experimental tech musings that spark my curiosity.

Consider it a living document of my journey through the wonderful chaos of technology—the successes, the failures, and everything in between.
