## Hey there! Welcome to the workshop.

I'm Jason, and this is where I document my journey through the wonderful chaos of technology. If you're looking for my professional portfolio, you can find that over at [jtcarrasco.com](https://jtcarrasco.com). But this space? This is where the fun stuff happens, the experiments, the failures, the late-night tinkering sessions, and those "I wonder if this will work?" moments that make tech so exciting.

## What is Cosmik Debris?

*"For a nominal service charge I could reach Nirvana tonight!"*

The name comes from a philosophy I've adopted over years of building, breaking, and rebuilding things: technology is beautifully chaotic. We're constantly collecting bits of knowledge, scraps of code, hardware components, and half-finished projects that somehow, eventually, come together into something meaningful. This site is my attempt to organize that cosmic debris into something useful—for you, and for future me who will inevitably forget how I solved that one obscure problem.

If you're curious about how this site came together, check out my post about [building a Jekyll site with AI](/posts/building-a-site-with-ai/)—it's a bit meta, but it documents the process.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is a living document of my adventures in:

### Maker Projects
From Raspberry Pi experiments to custom hardware builds, I'll be sharing the projects I'm working on. Expect detailed build logs, parts lists, what worked, what didn't, and plenty of "learn from my mistakes" moments. Whether it's home automation, custom keyboards, or whatever catches my interest next, you'll find the full story here—warts and all.

### Linux Journey
I'm deep into my Linux journey, and I want to share what I'm learning along the way. From distro-hopping adventures to scripting solutions for everyday problems, I'll document the tips, tricks, and troubleshooting that comes with living in the terminal. If you're also exploring Linux, maybe we can learn together.

### Tech Musings
Sometimes I just need to think out loud about technology—new tools I'm exploring, workflows I'm optimizing, or opinions on the tech landscape. Not everything needs to be a tutorial; sometimes it's just about sharing the thought process.

### Problem-Solving Documentation
You know those problems that take hours to solve, and you think "I should write this down"? That's what this blog is for. I'll be documenting solutions to the weird edge cases, the undocumented quirks, and the "why isn't this working?" moments that we all face.

## The Philosophy

I believe in learning by doing, failing forward, and sharing knowledge. Every project I build teaches me something new, even if—especially if—it doesn't work the first time. Or the second time. Or... you get the idea.

This blog won't be polished marketing speak or perfectly curated project showcases. It'll be real, sometimes messy, always honest documentation of my tech journey. If I mess something up, you'll hear about it. If I find a better way to do something I wrote about last month, I'll write an update.

The goal isn't to present myself as an expert—it's to be a fellow traveler on the journey, sharing what I learn as I learn it.

## What's Coming

I've got a backlog of projects I'm excited to write about:
- My current Linux setup and why I chose what I chose
- A hardware project I've been tinkering with (more on this soon)
- Scripts and tools I use to automate my workflow
- Reviews of maker tools and hardware I'm actually using

I'm aiming to post regularly, though "regularly" will depend on what I'm working on and what there is to share. Quality over quantity—I'd rather post something useful than post just to keep to a schedule.

## Let's Connect

Thanks for reading! I'm always interested in connecting with fellow makers, Linux enthusiasts, and tech tinkerers. Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jtcarrasco), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jtcarrasco.bsky.social), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jtcarrasco).

Questions, suggestions, or want to share what you're working on? Don't hesitate to reach out—this is meant to be a conversation.
